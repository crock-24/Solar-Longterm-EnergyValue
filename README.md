# Solar Forecasting with SARIMAX + Fourier Terms

This project uses SARIMAX models with Fourier terms to forecast daily solar energy generation. It is focused on time series techniques for modeling seasonality. The forecast is then converted into a dollar value of that energy produced. 

## Project Objectives:

- Forecast daily solar energy output using historical data only
- Capture strong yearly seasonality using Fourier terms
- Evaluate SARIMAX performance and parameter tuning
- Package insights into a reproducible forecasting pipeline
